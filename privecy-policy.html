          This policy sets out how we (Flock Associates Ltd) use and look after
          data and personal information. This includes what you tell us, what we
          learn from you, and the choices you give us about what marketing you
          want us to send you. This notice explains how we do this and tells you
          about privacy rights and how the law protects you. We may change this
          policy from time to time, so you should check this policy to ensure
          you are happy with any changes. This Privacy Policy replaces any other
          Privacy Policy previously applicable.
        </p>
        <h5>Our Privacy Promise</h5>
        <p>
          Personal information we may collect In general, you can visit our
          website without giving us any information, and we do not know who you
          are. By filling in forms on our website or by corresponding with us by
          telephone, email or otherwise you give us information. This includes
          information you provide when you register to use our website,
          subscribe or contract to our services or newsletter, search for
          services, participate in discussion boards or other social media
          functions with us, enter a competition, promotion or survey or when
          you chat to one of our sales or support personnel. The information you
          give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone
          number, personal description and photograph. If you are one of our
          anonymous website visitors, please bear in mind that we may still
          record the areas of the website which you visit and collect
          information about your computer, such as which browser you are using,
          your network location, the type of connection you are using (e.g.
          broadband, ADSL etc). We do this by using  Direct marketing We may,
          from time to time, use your personal data to tell you about relevant
          services, events, news, updates and offers. This is what we mean when
          we talk about ‘marketing’. The personal information we have for you is
          made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use our
          services, or from third parties we work with. We study this to form a
          view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest
          to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may
          be relevant for you. We may contact you by e-mail, phone, or mail,
          unless you have registered with the appropriate Preference Service or
          opted for us not to do so. We can only use your personal information
          to send you marketing if it’s relevant to you and/or you have opted to
          receive it. That is when we have a business or commercial reason to
          use your information. It must not unfairly go against what is right
          and best for you. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing by
          contacting us or unsubscribing at any time. Whatever you choose,
          you’ll still receive other important information such as project
          updates and to carry out our obligations under any contracts we have
          entered with you. We may ask you to confirm or update your
          preferences, in the future. We will also ask you to do this if there
          are changes in the law, regulation, or the structure of our business.
          If you change your mind you can update your choices at any time by
          contacting us. Keeping personal data Data we collect may be
          transferred and stored outside the European Economic Area (” EEA”). It

          ongoing support of services. By submitting your data, you agree to
          this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA. We will take
          all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that data we collect is
          treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In
          particular, this means that personal data will only be transferred to
          a country that provides an adequate level of protection (for example,
          where the European Commission has determined that a country provides
